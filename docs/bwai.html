        <div class="row" id="study">
            <p>Build with AI is a new way to create surveys, and it's powered by OpenAI. The user types short
                instructions. Then AI generates a survey accordingly. It's fast, accurate, and results in high-quality
                surveys.

            <p>It’s hard to write a good survey. You have to know what questions to ask, how to ask them, and in what
                order. And even if you can do all those things, writing a survey can take a lot of time. How could AI
                help?

        <div class="row" id="study">
            <p>As the sole content designer, I had several key responsibilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify content needs and opportunities.</li>
                <li>Name the feature.</li>
                <li>Write guidance copy and microcopy.</li>
                <li>Test content for usability.</li>

            <h2>Process</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row" id="study">
            <h4>Identifying content needs</h4>
            <p>I conducted the following foundational research:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Conversation mining</li>
                <li>Competitive analysis</li>
                <li>Prompt engineering exploration</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here’s my key takeaway: Nearly all GPT products offered sample prompts to help users get started. The
                product designer and I discussed these findings. We agreed that prompt writing would be our key
                challenge.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row" id="study">
            <h4>Naming the feature</h4>
            <p>I organized a feature naming workshop with cross functional stakeholders. Our activities were as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Align on criteria for the name.
                </li>
                <li>Brainstorm names according to those criteria.
                </li>
                <li>Choose three of our best options.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Then I surveyed 200 people and asked them which of those three names they liked best. Names appeared in
                random order to each respondent to prevent bias. I announced the winner to stakeholders and started
                working it into the product.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row" id="study">
            <h4>Writing the copy</h4>
            <p>I knew from my research that many users wouldn’t be able to write prompts without guidance. So I built on
                the idea of sample prompts from other products.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Novice users could use the prompts without making changes.
                </li>
                <li>More articulate users could edit the prompts to suit their needs.
                </li>
                <li>Savvy users could model their own prompts after our samples.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I worked with one of our survey methodology experts to develop and test the right prompt structure.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row" id="study">
            <h4>Testing the content</h4>
            <p>I tested a prototype with five real users to answer these questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Will people know what a prompt is?
                </li>
                <li>Is the purpose of the sample prompts clear?
                </li>
                <li>Does the term “sample prompt” make sense?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Participants attempted tasks like using one of the sample prompts and defining the word “prompt.” All
                participants were able to complete all tasks.
